<summary>Abstract</summary>
<div align="justify">  <small> The spatial configuration of domestic supply chains plays a crucial role in the transmission of shocks. This paper investigates the representativeness of formal sector firm-to-firm trade data in capturing domestic trade patterns in Kenya, a context with high informality. We document stylized facts showing that formal sector trade exhibits a distinct spatial concentration relative to overall economic activity. Linking transaction-level data with data on informal economic activity, we estimate a structural model and predict a revised network incorporating informal firms. We find that formal sector trade flows underaccount for trade within regions and across regions with stronger social ties. The higher the incidence of informality, the more we underestimate vulnerability to domestic shocks and overestimate exposure to import shocks. </small>  </div> </details>

<summary>Abstract</summary>
<div align="justify">  <small> Trading relationships between suppliers and buyers play a key role in transmitting both local and international shocks. We use transaction-level data from Kenya to study the relevance of a firm's domestic network position and links to international supply chains in determining its trajectory during the COVID-19 crisis. We document that firms with high exposure to import and export markets tend to be larger, older, and employ more workers. The specialisation of direct importers, often intermediaries, on international markets made them very vulnerable to the initial COVID-19 shock. Exporters, one-third of whom operate in primary sectors, experienced a less severe decline in sales. We find that both importers and exporters adjust their domestic supply chains in response to international trade shocks - before and during the crisis alike. Sourcing from international markets does not crowd out domestic purchases, while sales abroad and at home can act as substitutes. Diversified domestic supply chains helped firms to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and recover more strongly. </small>  </div> </details>

<summary>Abstract</summary>
<div align="justify"> <small> Real-time price data collection during crises is crucial for informing policy responses, but can be challenging due to fast-changing consumption and mobility patterns. We adopt a crowd-sourcing approach to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on prices of essential food items in Kenya and Uganda. Combining this price data with information on changes in mobility patterns, we find that a 10 percentage point reduction in mobility leads to a 0.3 percent and 1.5 percent increase in food prices in Kenya and Uganda, respectively. Our results are robust across a variety of empirical specifications, but we cannot conclusively rule out a zero effect in Kenya. Furthermore, our findings indicate that mobility patterns continue to impact price dynamics beyond the initial shutdown phase. </small> </div> </details>

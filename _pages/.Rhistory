<summary>Abstract</summary>
<div align="justify">  <small> Trading relationships between suppliers and buyers play a key role in transmitting both local and international shocks. We use rich transaction-level data from Kenya to study the relevance of a firm's domestic network position and links to international supply chains in determining its trajectory during the COVID-19 crisis. We document that firms with varying degrees of exposure to import and export markets differ substantially in terms of their size and age profile. The specialisation of direct importers, often intermediaries, on international markets made them very vulnerable to the initial COVID-19 shock. Exporters, one-third of which operate in primary sectors, experienced a less drastic downturn. We find that both importers and exporters adjust their domestic supply chains in response to international trade shocks. Sourcing from international markets crowds in domestic purchases, while sales abroad and at home are substitutes. Diversified domestic networks further helped to mitigate the impact of severe shocks like the COVID-19 crisis and contributed to a stronger recovery. </small>  </div> </details>

<div align="justify"> <small> Real-time price data collection during crises is crucial for informing policy responses, but can be challenging due to fast-changing consumption and mobility patterns. We adopt a crowd-sourcing approach to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on prices of essential food items in Kenya and Uganda. Combining this price data with information on changes in mobility patterns, we find that a 10 percentage point reduction in mobility leads to a 0.3 percent and 1.5 percent increase in food prices in Kenya and Uganda, respectively. Our results are robust across a variety of empirical specifications, but we cannot conclusively rule out a zero effect in Kenya. Furthermore, our findings indicate that mobility patterns continue to impact price dynamics beyond the initial shutdown phase. </small> </div> </details>

We discuss how tax returns can be used to map Kenya’s domestic firm and describe the network’s fundamental properties. Where possible we document how those properties align with firm networks in other contexts for which similar data are available. </small>  </div> </details>
